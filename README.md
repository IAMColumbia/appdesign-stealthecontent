# Application Design - Steal the content

## Stage One

1. Clone this repository.
2. Create your own branch.  Name it "firstname-lastname-stage1".
2. Take a look at [client/stealthecontent.js](client/stealthecontent.js).  This is a pure content representation of I saw [when I googled "boring"](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=boring).
3. Choose a similar content rich site where you could do the same thing.  It should be a site that is highly dynamic in nature, meaning it changes based on your query or over time due to user activity.  Examples: CNN, Facebook, BoingBoing
4. Remove the object from the `data` helper and replace it with the content from your choosen site.  If there's text there, copy-and-paste it, if the page has images, grab the urls to the images. Note: I'm not including anything static like button names or links from the navigation.  I want content only, not parts of the UI that stay the same page to page!
5. Commit your new version of the data

## Stage Two
1. Look through the existing stage1 branches and choose once differnt than your own.
